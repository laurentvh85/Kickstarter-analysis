# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
In this project, the goal was to help Louise with her campaign for a theatrical production. She estimated that her play will cost around $12,000

After doing analysis on the data, we see that theatre productions, specifically plays have a high success rate.

However, her project cost of around $12,000 puts her right around the highest point of the quartile. The chart below is from all US plays.

The standard deviations are around 2x the IQR in each distribution. In the failed projects it is almost 3x the IQR. Some of the goals must have been really large.

There also seems to be a bit of seasonality in the data. May and June have the highest successful campaigns

My reccomendation to Louise is to launch her campaign in either May or June. I would also suggest that she lower her goal to be closer to the median or mean.
